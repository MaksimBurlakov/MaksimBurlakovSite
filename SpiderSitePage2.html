<p>Scorpions are very interesting creatures that come in all shapes and sizes, which actually says a lot about them, for example a small scorpion is probably going to have a lethal venom hidden in its tail.</p>

<h3>Glowing</h3>

<p>Scorpions have an interesting property of being able to glow under moonlight/black light which happens because they have a special skin specifically designed to protect them from UV radiation and as a side effect they glow in moonlight. </p>

<p>Scorpions have a very facinating way of giving birth to their kin, they don't use eggs orany other typical way other insects their size use, they just give birth like mammals. They also look very cute while carrying their offspring on their own back.</p>
