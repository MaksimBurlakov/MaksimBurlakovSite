<h1>My favorite type of Millipede</h1>
<ul>

<h3>A lot of legs</h3>

<p>Sometimes people mistake these little guys for centipedes, but there are not the same thing! Millipedes have a lot more legs in general and unlike centipedes they don't have any venom! so they are safe to hold on your hand, the only thing you are going to feel is a million tiny legs tapping in sync.</p>

<h3>Defense mechanism</h3>

<p>Millipedes have an interesting self defense mechanism, where they would wrap themselves into a tight coil. They do this to protect their soft undersides,legs and their head </p>

<h3>Diet<h3>

<p>Diet of these little trains of the forest mostly consists of dead matter like dead leaves,so if you find them in your house you have nothing to worry about,they probably got there by accident. And despite having many legs they are a slow moving bunch,so help them by bringing them back to the forest.</p>
