<p>I love jumping spiders, they are one of the smallest spiders on the planet, although there are a lot of different types of spiders, some can be as small as a finger tip others can almost fit in the palm of your hand.</p>

<h3>Very smart for a spider</h3>

<p>Despite them being very small, which in turn means they have very small brains, they are considered to be one of the smartest spiders! They are naturally curious and also have a very powerful tool thanks to their brain, and it is to be able to remember.</p>

<h3>Little Hunters<h3>

<p>Their legs are very strong so they are very fast and alsob are able to jump, which is helpful since they are the type of a spider to actively hunt for food, sometimes these little spiders even hunt down species of other spiders that are much bigger than themselves. </p>
